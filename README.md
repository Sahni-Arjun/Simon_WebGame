# Simon_WebGame
Basic Simon memory game

To play the game, clone the repository and paste the path of the file "index.html" in your browser.

You will see instructions if you click the instructions button, however I will explain them briefly here.
* Memorize the button that flashes and click it
* When the second button flashes memorize the button, then click the entire sequence of buttons (1 and 2).
* As the game goes on, the number of buttons you have to remember each time, and then click in order, will increase by 1.
